This little script will take all *.vpx files and extract which rom is used and pack it together as described in https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball/blob/10.8.1/standalone/docs/ios/README.md

table/
      <table.vpx>
      pinmame/
              roms/
                  <rom.zip>

into tablename.vpxz

Double click the script in a folder full of table.vpx files.
